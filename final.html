         <p>Taking an introductory writing course at Michigan State University has been a journey in writing, revising, and researching. You will use everything you know about the writing process to supplement the plethora of new strategies, techniques, and methods that you will be utilizing in every step of this course. You will construct your own website, maintain your own blog, be immersed in the captivating world of HTML, and do research at a depth you may have never ventured before. With this essay I will use what I have learned this year to prepare you for the experience ahead of you. First, I will explore the critical nature of reading in this course, discuss arrangement and structure of information within essays, and address the concept that research as an epistemic and recursive process that acts as form of discussion in a sense. Then, I will go over each of the various assignments in this course and discuss what I have learned and share some advice on how to approach these assignments in a lucrative manner.</p>

<br />
<p>Reading is very heavily used amid the writing process. It is no secret that reading is very important for any writer. To simplify things, there are two major types of reading that take place in this class. The first major form is reading the syllabus. The syllabi in this class can sometimes be wordy and confusing, but manageable if you know what you’re doing. Before you begin writing a several thousand word essay, you really want to make sure you have the clear understanding of what the professor really wants from you. What I do is copy/paste the syllabus into a word document and break it down into multiple segments. I underline certain sentences and I bold certain words to ensure that I am hitting all the important points and that I don’t ramble further and further away from the syllabus. After writing all the different segments, I fuse them together by adding transition statements or paragraphs. Staying on topic is a critical if you want to earn that perfect grade! By organizing the main topics from a syllabus in a way that aids your writing process, staying on topic comes naturally. </p>

<br />
<p>The next form of reading you’ll be doing in this class is more obvious. This class is heavily research based, and you’ll be doing a lot of reading to supplement your writing. Whether you are looking up major paths for your lived experiences project, reading up on social phenomenon for the cultural analysis, or researching research itself for your formal research assignment, reading is no rarity in this class. When you are looking at material, you must first ensure that it is credible. Usually, university publications or research studies are a safe bet. Then, as you read you must constantly ask yourself questions about the material to ensure that you are extracting all the right points that you might potentially write about. Questions such as “what am I reading?”, “what is being studied?”, and “what did they do and what did they conclude?” are all good places to start. </p>

<br />
<p>After organizing your thoughts and preparing the material, it is time to start writing. Arrangement of ideas in an essay is imperative to whether or not the reader is going to walk away with anything or not. Throughout this course, you’ll realize that breaking down ideas and concept into small yet meaningful portions is more effective than giving everything away at once. This serves three main purposes. First of all, this balances the pace of the essay. When writing lengthy essays, there needs to be information being relayed at a consistent pace throughout. This will keep you on track and your reader interested. The next reason is that breaking down large ideas into smaller ones helps you elaborate on each portion sufficiently in order to successfully deliver an idea. Small details that would have been skimmed over tend to come out when writing in this way. Finally, the third reason is that your audience needs to remain interested, which means that they need something to look forward to as they are reading. They could look forward to the solution to the issue you are discussing, or maybe to the climax of a story – there needs to be incentive to continue reading. Breaking down your ideas can help you manage this incentive and fit it in where you think it will be most forceful.</p>

<br />
<p>When looking at the core of research, one can see that it is essentially a discussion. It can be a discussion between the group of researchers and the scientific community, it could between the researcher and the peer review, between student to teacher, between one author to another, etc. When one conducts research and produces material as a result, he does it with the intention that it is going to be read, analyzed, and if it is the goal, deliver a message. This means that in order for the research to be effective, it must be thorough in that it collects information from multiple sources and covers all the necessary points or factors. If research was derived from one source or one community, then it wouldn’t be research-it would simply be paraphrasing. Research is the culmination of many communities’ ideas or productions processed through an individual’s (or group of individuals’) unique mindset and perspectives. This is why research is extensively involved in reading. It calls for heavy revision and analysis of one’s own work because it is going to scrutinized by whatever potential audience that will read it. In terms of succeeding in this writing course, you must keep in mind that the research you explore and utilize is not just a simple extraction of information, but part of a larger discussion between various communities. </p>

<br />
<p>The first major assignment in this course is the Lived Experiences project. I believe that this assignment acts a warm up - preparing you and your writing abilities for the projects ahead. Your goal is to write a meaningful essay about your career goals and the academic path you will take in order to reach them. To catalyze your essay you will be implementing how a piece of technology led to your field. First, you must think to yourself and make clear what you currently want to do in life, then if necessary, you must do some research to figure out the academic steps it takes to reach those goals. The next major assignment is the cultural analysis proposal. This is where real research comes into play. You must describe a social issue and it’s ties to a cultural artifact, and you must describe a solution to said issue. In order to succeed in this assignment, you must pick an issue you feel strong about. This will lead you to investigate it more thoroughly and you will produce more meaningful material. Decide on a cultural artifact that has strong, relevant ties to your issue. The third assignment is the Formal Research Project. As the name suggests, this is where real research takes place in this class. You must find actual research on an academic discipline and use it to supplement your writing. You will be given a separate assignment that teaches you the ins and outs of locating relevant and useful research but it will be up to you to efficiently extract information from it. This is where you must ask yourself if the research you have picked is relevant because you will be doing a lot of writing on it. Again, this is the longest assignment and is the most time consuming so my best advice is to actually read and understand the research you choose before you begin writing to ensure that it is actually what you are looking for. Finally, you will work on a group assignment called the multimedia remix project. This is a unique assignment in which you are asked to take one of the previous assignments in the course that you or one of your group members have written and shift it to another media. You will utilize different methods to communicate the message and good teamwork is crucial. Throughout this course, you will be implementing html components with your essays by doing things such as maintaining a website or breaking down your essay into multiple functioning web pages.You will learn how to do these things by using an integrative side course on a website called “codecademy”. My only advice with this is to complete the modules in a timely manner so that you will be prepared for the html usage that takes place throughout the course.

All in all, there is a lot to learn from this class. Whether it is learning what your academic and professional goals really are, how to prepare and carry out a heavy research based paper, or how to work efficiently in a team to create a documentary, there are many things to conquer and benefit from. This is truly a course that will expand your academic skill set and help shape you into an overall better student. </p>
