			<h1>Background Information: The Healthcare Discipline</h1>
			<p>
The healthcare Discipline is one of the nation's largest academic disciplines. There were 48,014 medical students accepted in 2013, which is a 6.1% from last year and beats the previous record set in 1996 by 1,049 students (Strauss).  Many people think that medical students aim to work at hospitals when they think of medical school, but in reality it is much more complex than that. Today’s health care industry is divided into sectors and is powered by the efforts of professionals and paraprofessionals to satisfy the health needs of the population. In order to better manage the finance and organization of the healthcare discipline, the healthcare industry is divided into three parts by the United Nations (ISIC) system. These parts are Hospital Activities, Medical and Dental Practice activities, and “Other Human Health” Activities. 

<br><br>

The United Nations Statistics Division defines Hospital Activities as “the activities of general and specialized hospitals, rehabilitation [centers], leprosaria, dental [centers] and other health institutions which have accommodation facilities, including military base and prison hospitals.”(Human Health Activities). In order for something to fall under the category of Hospital Activities, it must be mainly aimed towards in patients and occurs under medical doctors’ direct supervision. 

<br><br>
 The next subdivision of the health care industry is Medical and dental practice activities. These include “consultation and treatment activities of general physicians and medical specialists including dentists…, activities of doctors of general medicine or medical specialists or surgeons in health institutions (including hospital out-patient clinics and departments of pre-paid groups of physicians) or private practice…, and activities carried in firms, schools, houses for the aged, [labor] organizations and fraternal organizations.”(Human Health Activities) As far as dentistry in this field, the UN asserts that “Dental activities may be of general or specialized nature and can be carried out in a private practice or in out-patient clinics including clinics attached to firms, schools, etc., as well as in operating rooms” (Human Health Activities) in order to be officially considered under “Medical and dental practice”.


<br><br>
Other human health activities consist of everything that one would consider health related that has not been mentioned in the two preceding categories, or in other words- all activities for human health that are not performed in hospitals or not performed by doctors or dentists.  Namely, this involves “activities of, or under the supervision of, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists or other para-medical practitioners in the field of optometry, hydrotherapy, medical massage, occupational therapy, speech therapy, chiropody, homeopathy, chiropractice, acupuncture, etc…, activities [that are] carried out in health clinics such as those attached to firms, schools, homes for the aged,  [labor] organizations and fraternal organizations, in residential health facilities other than hospitals, as well as in own consulting rooms, patients' homes or elsewhere…,activities of dental auxiliaries such as dental therapists, school dental nurses and dental hygienists...Also included are clinics of pathological and other diagnostic activities carried out by independent laboratories…, activities of blood banks, ambulance and air-ambulance activities, and residential health facilities except hospitals.”  (Human Health Activities). 

<br><br>
Looking over these categories makes it clear just how vast and intricate the healthcare discipline is. Remarkably, one can follow any major and end up in any of these fields as training begins in medical school (which accepts all majors as long as requirements are met). There is no specific major or academic path one has to take in order to reach medical school and become integrated into the health care discipline, but regardless of the path one decides to take, one thing is for certain medical research is heavily involved.
