			<h1>Anticipated Results and Effects</h1>
			<p> 
	Following these steps can lead to considerable results. Halting the acceptance of ghetto music will slow down the perpetuation of the themes this music contributes. Besides the obvious benefits, the rejection of ghetto dress and demeanor can play a psychological role in internalizing the idea that ghetto culture is no longer something one would flaunt. Valuing education will bring the youth of the streets and into schools, and truly valuing education can lead to the exposure of a great deal of information- resulting in inspiration to reach for higher places rather than being inspired by the materialistic ideologies of the ghettos. Obeying just laws is imperative helps fight the anti-society thought process of ghetto culture, which can be channeled in a healthy way by working to change unjust laws. And finally, gaining dignity and respect for oneself is a crucial step in authenticating the decision to subscribe to the “anti-ghetto” culture, motivating others who strive to reach this point to unsubscribe from the ghetto mentality as well.
