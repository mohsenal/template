	<h2>Ali Mohsen - Personal Memo</h2>
	<p>This project changed my view of group work. All my life, when I was assigned to work I knew that I would have to do the majority of the work because of unreliable or lazy group mates. However, this assignment was a completely new experience to me. My group mates and I actively met and collaborated. When we were together ideas were flowing and fruitful discussion took place. We set deadlines and all made efforts to meet them. We criticized each other’s contributions and made them even better.  All in all, the group interaction in this project – for the three of us that participated—was very successful.

	But, by “the three of us that participated” I mean me, Carson, and Nate.  Jiandan Hu, The fourth group member was nonexistent throughout the whole process. She didn’t show up to class on 3/31 or any day after that. She made no efforts to contact us and when we reached out to her multiple times we received no reply. Literally, her only contribution was the fact that she created the google docs document and invited us all. She didn’t write a single word in it.  To account for her complete lack of participation Carson, Nate, and I divided her workload among the three of us and successfully completed our tasks.

 	The issue we chose was racial profiling in airports. Being an Arab- American, I am no stranger to this phenomenon. Many airport trips growing up were extended for “random checks” involving my parents or my belongings. These experiences helped me design the video in a way that can allow me to convey these things to an audience I grew up with and understand. When we planning this video, we asked ourselves how we would create this video to appeal to our target audience, which was the MSU student body. We concluded that it would be in our best interest to employ pathos to grab the attention of our audience and to conclude the video through stories from Spartans themselves. This allows our audience to relate to the message we are sending by emphasizing the emotional significance of this topic.
</p><p>
 	An obstacle we faced while organizing and composing this documentary stemmed from the fact none of us had much experience constructing a video that flows efficiently and seamlessly. The pace of information in an essay is different so we had to test different ideas and make modifications to finally construct something that worked. 
</p><p>
 	The most challenging part of the project was the communication, and this was an issue only during the first few days. Because I missed the first day of this project due to illness, I had no means of communicating to my group members aside from their emails, which no one seemed to check. But after our initial meeting, the three of us exchanged numbers and communication was no longer an issue. 
 	</p><p>
 	The research recourses that were most beneficial to me were looking up statistics and reading reports of incidences which were helpful in allowing us to think in the right context. We had to essentially convert some shocking numbers into video format, and we did that through narration and specialized interview questions. If I were to this project again and had more time I would find a way to secure a better camera and I would interview a wider sample of people. Then I would pick out the best of the best interviews to be in the final documentary. 
</p><p>
	In conclusion, I feel like this assignment was a successful endeavor. I worked with a group whose work I could trust. We created ideas and implemented the ones that worked and shot down the ones that didn’t. We defined the message we were trying to convey and worked together to produce a video that conveyed it efficiently. This project was a positive experience that I have learned a lot from.
