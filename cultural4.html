			<h1>Description of Ghetto Culture and the Implications of its Popularity</h1>
			<p>Videos on WorldStar reflect the conditions of life in improvised communities, also known as the “ghetto”. What is troubling is the traffic these videos receive. In society, mindless violence is not an attractive quality in any sense.  However, when those who visit the site are desensitized by the obscene material, content that is more and more shocking needs to be provided to entertain the websites visitors. Another significant effect is the glorification of the contexts of the video, the culture of the hood, the ghetto. The glorification of the ghetto is a social issue that is becoming more and more prevalent—at an alarming rate.  
Starting from inner city “hoods”, Ghetto culture is starting to appeal to a diverse audience around the world.  As its popularity increases, so does its negative impact on youth.  Ghetto culture essentially flaunts what were once defamed attributes of the people living in the hood, diminishing the potential for improvement of people in such unfortunate conditions while also damaging people who are not. Ghetto Culture begins with hip-hop. More specifically, it is forms of hip hop that reflect urban crime and violent lifestyles such as gangsta rap, trap hip-hop, and trap music. These styles typically contain lyrics that are generally comprised of boastful or arrogant behavior in terms of crime and materialism. But ghetto culture only stems out from there, consisting of established street codes of behavior and a refusal of social norms. This refusal of social convention leads to a core mentality of underachievement that has been spreading to today’s youth. One of the most troubling aspects of this phenomenon is the idea that following conventional culture is a sign of weakness, which is to be avoided at all costs as weakness is a central misdeed in the culture of the ghetto. As a result of this, people who embrace the ghetto culture mentality feel pushed to externalize this concept, recognizing and thus approving the deferment of important social conventions that are crucial to future achievement.
	Ghetto Culture also idolizes the possession of materialistic commodities that signify wealth and success, and the quick retrieval of these objects. Young men aim to display their “bling” or “swag” to demonstrate their assumed sense of prevalence, to the point where material objects serve as a tool to measure self-worth. This is supplemented by how “thuggish” one presents themselves to be, which is generally demonstrated through baggy clothing, ghetto phrasing, and reputation on the street. Of course, the hailed street reputation is mainly derived from the accumulation of illegal and violent acts one has successfully executed. This mentality is then perpetuated by young woman immersed in ghetto culture who accept and even seek out such attributes. 
	Many obvious issues arise from the glorification of ghetto culture. As more people immerse themselves in such a lifestyle, they slowly become the majority. People who are not yet fully involved with this way of life become demoralized and coerced into conforming to their peers. For said peers, demoralizing people who do not conform into ghetto culture is just part of the package, as accusing others of being insufficiently ghetto serves to validate their notion of how “ghetto” they really are. When people take on this mentality, they accept it as what is considered correct in society, what is the norm—leading to pressing consequences. For example, someone who thinks this way would see no harm in going to a job interview with baggy clothing or ghetto diction. Another serious consequence of ghetto glorification is exemplified in WorldStarHipHop.com.
	In the case of WorldStarHipHop, ghetto culture is rampant through these videos and the increasing virality serves to prove the increasing popularity of ghetto culture. The able-bodied bystanders in every fight clip do nothing to prevent the inevitable outcomes. When people accept ghetto culture as a way of life, a potentially deadly fight between two individuals is seen as a normal occurrence. The more violent the fight, the more bloody the outcome, the more excited the onlookers become. People’s immediate reaction is to pull out their phones and record what they are witnessing, fanatically shouting “WorldStar!, WorldStar!” as if to signify that a social ritual has begun that cannot be disturbed. Ghetto culture spreads a mob mentality that insists that it is perfectly acceptable to treat other humans barbarically, and it conditions the idea that negativity and violence in everyday life is normal.
Ghetto culture is no longer only a medium for rebellion. As Ghetto culture spreads through the minds of the upcoming generation, we take steps away from the continuation and success of society. It is time that solutions are implemented to prevent this phenomenon from wreaking any more havoc.
The Solution
	When one flaunts ghetto ideologies and embraces a ghetto lifestyle, they are part of the problem. What this means is that to diminish the spread of ghetto culture, the idea that flaunting the characteristics of such a culture is acceptable must be expunged.  Ghetto culture must be refused and society must normalize and commend an anti-ghetto culture. This involves many steps that may seem like ordinary attributes at first, but aim to rehabilitate the core obstacles within the ghetto culture mentality. These include the dismissal of ghetto music or music that glorifies the principles of ghetto culture, the rejection of ghetto dress and demeanor, the recognition of the value of education in all forms (and just as importantly- the refusal to celebrate ignorance), obeying just laws and working to change unjust laws and finally to gain dignity and respect for oneself while aiming to become a motivational example of what unsubscribing from a ghetto mentality can lead one to achieve.
