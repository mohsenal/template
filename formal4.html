			Research in the Medical Field
			<br><br>
Research is one of the driving forces of the medical field consists of the basic research, applied research, or translational research that aims to advance and reinforce the body of knowledge in the field of medicine. The majority of medical research is empirical, it follows a series of specific steps and shortcuts are avoided. A carefully constructed protocol should drive the collection and analysis of evidence, bio-statistical methods are used to reach a credible and re-creatable conclusion, and of course medical research must comply with the customary system of medical and research ethics. 
<br><br>
Medical Ethics is a big part of medical research. All medical research done on humans has to strictly abide to the confines of medical ethics. Medical Ethics is comprised of system of moral principles that specify judgments and values that should be made while the field of medicine is practiced.  There are four basic moral principles that exist within virtually every version of the medical ethical code out there. These four principles are Respect for autonomy, Beneficence, Non-Maleficence, and Justice. Respect for autonomy implies that every patient has the right to refuse their treatment. Beneficence connotes that the person applying should prioritize the best interest of the patient. Non-maleficence emphasizes the fact that no harm shall be purposely done to the patient, and Justice signifies that the decision of who gets what treatment is fair and un-biased regardless of outlying factors such as scarce health resources. 
<br><br>
The field of medical research contains a wide spectrum of objectives that all ultimately aim to improve the health of people in one way or another. There are two main types of medical research: Basic and Applied Medical Research. Basic medical research (sometimes called pure research) aims to add more information to the medical field without necessarily having emphasis on application of that information. The information gained from such research is gained with the notion that one day this knowledge will be useful or even imperative. Usually, basic research explores biological concepts at the cellular level, in an effort to elaborate biological process and cellular functions.  The other type of medical research, applied research, aims to specifically solve an existing issue and is more problem oriented. According to renowned medical scholar Abhaya Indrayan the applied medical research category can be further broken down into two divisions:  Primary which includes of Conventional research and Secondary which includes of unconventional research. The Primary category consists of “descriptive studies such as surveys, case-series, and census, as also analytical studies such as case-control studies and clinical trials and conventional research ;  The second category includes unconventional research [and] operations research (prioritization, optimization, simulation, etc.), evaluation of health systems (assessing quality and adequacy), economic studies (cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, etc.), qualitative research (focus group discussion), and research synthesis (reviews and meta-analysis)”(Indrayan 94). The figure below was derived from Dr. Abhaya Indrayan’s “Elements of Medical Research” and provides a visual representation of the types of medical research.
<br><br>
	There are four levels of medical research. The first level of medical research is conducted in the process of completing a master’s thesis. The main purpose of this level of research is to train medial students in research but there are sometimes results that have important implications to medical community and generally to society. This level of research is usually smaller in scale and is considered a thesis as its function is to put forward a hypothesis that can be studied and researched further.(Indrayan 94) The next level of medical research is that od Doctoral dissertations. This research aims to uncover new results that were previously unknown. “A dissertation is a detailed discourse or treatise on a particular topic that provides a new perspective to a phenomenon” states Dr. Indrayan, “Since conducted by one person mostly 
within limited institutional resources, this level of research also is rarely able to make headlines”(Indrayan 94). The third level of medical research is the level of institution. Large organizations are capable of producing large scale research that evokes discussion in the field. This research is can change the way medicine is practiced (Indrayan 95). The field of medicine has critical deviations and uncertainties, sparking the need for the fourth and most powerful level of medical research, which is usually a large-scale multicentric study that follows a common protocol. The observations are gathered together and the information is used to create a reliable conclusion. Studies like this are not limited to the confines of one country and can be conducted at an international level. This research attracts a lot of attention because of its sheer magnitude but it doesn’t necessarily produce groundbreaking results more often than organization-level research (Indrayan 95). Medical research in all four levels follows the same rigid defined structure, and for good reason. 
<br><br>

The structure of medical research does not fluctuate and follows a systematic pattern in order to produce valid, testable results. Figure 2 shows an example of the highly specific requirements that a renowned medical journal (Mayo Clinic) enforces for its publication. Because of the high frequency of uncertainties and the delicate factor of human health, the step by step approach of medical research is typically more elaborate than other forms of scientific research. The investigative process of medical research is essential due to its heavy reliance on empirical results (Bukhari 3). The proceeding summary of preinvestigation, investigation, and postinvestigation steps is condensed from Dr. Abhaya Indrayan’s “Elements of Medical Research” article from the Indian Journal of Medical Research.
<br><br>

The first step of the preinvestigation is to identify the problem. Once a research question is identified, the researcher must confirm that it is relevant, applicable, and feasible.  After the research question is identified and deemed acceptable, the next step is to collect and evaluate existing information. Medical literature and secondary data available through several types of sources should be investigated.  The goal of this step is to identify specific known information and to be able to identify where there is missing data (in an incidence that is referred to as a “data gap”), and use this knowledge to determine how the research study fits into the “medical jigsaw puzzle”.  The next step is to formulate research objectives and hypothesis. This is important as it gives direction to the study and understanding the objectives is imperative in formulating a hypothesis.  Following this the research is to identify the study subjects. What is the target population that is being studied? This step aims to clarify what part of the population is included and also in some cases which members of the population are excluded.  Now, it is time to think of a design. The ultimate goal is to get a valid and reliable answer to the research questions or a solution to the issue, so in this step preparations are drawn out in order to succeed.  The researcher must account for things such as what tools would be required, the number of cases or subjects that are necessary for the investigation or what methods will be used to obtain unbiased data from the variables involved in the study. The researcher must then write the protocol. A list of detailed and specific steps on the procedure will be followed in the study and will be examined to confirm the credibility of this study, so this step is crucial. The last step in the preinvestigation portion of a study is to develop the tools. The tools can be anything from surveys or questionnaires to measurement and investigation tools.

<br><br>
Now it is time for the actual investigation. The first course of action is to pretest and do a pilot study.  This tools that will be used must be tested to ensure that they will produce sufficient results in actual conditions. The time has come to conduct the study and collect the data. The data must be good quality data meaning that it is obtained without bias and honestly recorded. This step is very important, as data is the foundation of medical research. Patrick Ochieng, a Biology Lab instructor at Michigan State University who is a PhD candidate with heavy background in chemistry and biochemistry, believes data is a crucial aspect medical research. “Data” he states when asked what he believes is the most important part of a medical research paper, “Because that’s what tells your story”. He also adds that “[data] is what provides evidence for particular research” (Ochieng).  After collecting the data the researcher must handle the nonresponse and ethical issues. It is typical that some subjects of the study will drop out or refuse, which according to the guidelines of medical ethics is completely acceptable for the participant to do. The researcher must address problems caused by this before finally moving on to the final step, which is to scrutinize the data. The data must be scrutinized to ensure consistency and external validity. 
<br><br>

Finally, the researcher has reached the postinvestigation steps. The first order of business is to analyze the data, which consists of preparing a master chart, summarizing the data, exploring the data in terms of patterns, and employing statistical analysis.  Then the researcher needs to interpret the results. Statistical analysis is mostly computer based, so this is the step where critical thinking comes in. What are the final conclusions, does it develop knowledge previously known? Or does it establish entirely new notions that are suggested by the data? These are questions that should be answered and not only must the researcher be convinced of the correctness of the conclusions but the reasoning must be strong enough to convince others. It is at this point that the researcher is to write the report. A report is simply a generic term that includes a thesis, dissertation, article, paper, and project report. This is the most important step in the medical research process as it provides the world entrance into the research investigation and allows the medical community to provide feedback regarding inadequacies and strong points. According to Dr. Indrayan, “the report should be sufficiently detailed that can remove any doubt a reader might have about any aspect of the results. It should be properly worded, with a clear demarcation of the evidence-based results, and your opinions on various aspects under research. The report should be adequately illustrated by diagrams where they can enhance the clarity. Numerical results can be summarized in the form of tables” (Indrayan 98). He also explains that the limitations must be openly described and that “the format of the report must be geared to meet the expectations of the audience” (98). The final responsibility of the researcher is to monitor the reactions. Research is a continuous process, and the reactions of the users of the results and comments from the medical community should be taken into consideration.

More on Medical Research

	An good example of medical research in the form of a scholarly article would is 2010 study by Marc-James Hallam, Tania Cubison,  Baljit Dheansa, and Chris Imray titled “Managing Frostbite”. This is a scholarly journal from the international edition of the British Journal of Medicine.  It discusses frostbite and investigates multiple components of frostbite, including prevention, treatment, and complications (Marc-James Hallam, et al). This is an exemplary medical research paper. The researchers first identify the problem, which is the prevalence of frostbite, and then they collect and evaluate existing information from previous research and multiple sources. They formulate research objectives and hypothesis which is to “identify factors predispose to frostbite and pathological mechanisms involved in the injury”(Marc-James Hallam, et al). They also identify the study subjects which are members of the general population. When they did write the report the data was organized and clear with multiple visuals to help present the information to the target audience.

	Another satisfactory medical article—this time from a trade publication—is an article titled Anabolic steroids by Euan Lawson. This article summarizes a medical study that discusses the possibility of anabolic steroids being addictive (Lawson 1). It conveys practical information for professionals in the field but is also moderately brief and contains straightforward language so that the intended audience (of potential anabolic steroid abusers) can comprehend the message. Medical research can be represented in various ways past the finalized report, and in terms of a condensed article that goes over the main points of a lengthy research study, this article is a great example.

	The process of scientific research is highly complex, and when it comes to medical research, this fact is even more apparent.  It is important to ensure that there is a structure in which the information can be delivered to the medical community and ultimately to society efficiently and thoroughly. Mohamad Mohsen M,D is a certified dermatologist who completed training at Wayne State Medical School, Detroit, Michigan. He currently practices at Gordy Skin Care in Detroit. When asked to elaborate on the rigid and intricate structure of a medical research paper, Dr. Mohsen explained that “it is the financial background of the process that calls for such rigorous standards to be in place”. He went on to explain “funding is no joke. Medical Research can get expensive and in order to socially engineer the maximum amount funding possible, it must be very clear what [the researcher] aims to do. A standard structure makes for transparency, something research bodies need to have in order to decide how much money [the researcher] will get”(Mohsen).
