			<h1>Cultural Artifact: WorldStarHipHop.com Analysis and Description</h1>
			<p>WorldStarHipHop.com is an online video aggregator that has risen to extreme popularity over recent years.  Many people refer to WorldStarHipHop (referred to WorldStar or WSHH for short) as an “internet cesspool”, and for good reason. WorldStarHipHop.com is essentially a culmination of videos that reflects urban cultures lowest point—the ghetto—streaming videos of violent fights and public sexual acts.  In 2005, this website began with the goal of releasing music and discussing hip-hop news, but it has since become exploiter of urban decay and unfortunate socio-economic conditions. O’Denat (AKA “Q”) is the man behind WorldStar, claiming that his initial goal was to distribute mixtapes to the hip-hop community. But when hackers took the site down not long after it was released, O’Denat re-opened the site with new intentions: collect and stream videos relating to “urban life”.  Nowadays, WorldStar ranks as the 759thth most visited website in the world, which is undermined by the fact that in the United States, it ranks as the 221st (Alexa). From 2009 to 2012 WorldStar was dubbed the “top hip-hop and urban culture website” by Black Entertainment Television (BET). The videos WorldStarHipHop promotes have been becoming increasingly more viral. It is no secret that this website is growing in popularity, with serious implications. A video of 3 men assaulting somebody on a train that would of brought in a few thousand views in 2011 now brings in hundreds of thousands (Zurawik). What this essentially means is that we as a society are glorifying and in turn condoning the ghetto culture.

 	One of the main attributes of the website are fight compilations, usually featured on the first page. These are five to ten minute videos that are composed of fight clips which feature someone getting knocked out, physically injured, or attacked. Fight compilations are released every two to three weeks and bring in a significant portion of the websites traffic.  A quick scan of fight compilation descriptions is enough to understand what they offer: “McDonalds Brawl Letting It All Out, Tall Guy Vs Little Guy, Big Girl Gives A Whoopin, Gas Station Brawl, Whole Hood Jumps 2 Dudes” and the general trend continues. In watching these videos, many common themes arise. For example it is a regular occurance to hear the recorder of the video (and usually people in the background) whimsically chanting “Worldstar!” signifying that the current fight is compilation worthy. When someone in the video has been knocked out or brutally injured, even more fanatical “WorldStar” shouts are inevitable.  Besides the fight compilations, other depraved videos can be found. “Girl Fights her Own Mother”, “Man Throws Girlfriend Down Manhole”, “Mother Drags Baby Across Street”, “Herd of Sheep Crushed by truck” and other generally asinine content is scattered in abundance across the site.  
Many people who watch WorldStar claim that it does not promote depraved behavior, but simply reflects the depravities that occur amid ghetto communities.  The legal standing of WorldStar is secure as it’s protected under freedom of speech laws, but it is a falsehood to claim that WorldStar is a “truth-telling” website. Rahiel Tesfamariam is an activist whose article in the Washington Post describes what responsible truth telling is. She explains that responsible truth-telling seeks to change present conditions by speaking the unspeakable in hopes of demanding change. A quick glance at the content of this website shows that it is the polar opposite. She continues to assert that “[WorldStarHipHop] is not in the business of truth-telling but rather voyeurism of violence. To defend the site is to argue that there is value in repeatedly watching violence done to others in hopes that our zeal for justice would be ignited. At that point, we are no longer passive spectators. We then become complicit in the violence and destruction we seek to end” (Tesfamariam).
