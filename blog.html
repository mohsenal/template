                        <h1 style = "color:yellow; font-family: Antiqua">Blog Entry #1: Homosexuality Video</h1>
                        <p style = "size: 20px; color:white; text-align: center; font-family: Antiqua">The goal of this video is to shift societal attitudes towards homosexuality. The video attempts achieve its purpose by utilizes pathos as part of discussing a narrative in which the narrator’s gay uncle commits suicide. The narrator discusses the emotional outcomes of this event in a way that a wide audience can relate to.Structurally, this video begins with a presentation that introduces the topic of gay acceptance and is followed by the narrator telling the story. He conveys it in a way that heavily relies on pathos (emotional appeal). He discusses how his uncle lived and how his social pressures ultimately caused him to commit suicide. The narrator then discusses how this event caused him and the rest of his family to feel.  This structure helps the video achieve it’s goals by allowing the viewer to place themselves in he narrators shoes. The video ends with a presentation that wraps up the videos message and presents a message to gay people who need help coping with their situation. In terms of my Lived Experience project, this video shows a good example of pathos and if that was a tool that I decide to employ, this video would provide a good example.</p>

                        <h1 style = "color:yellow; font-family: Antiqua">Blog Entry #2: Make Love, not Warcraft</h1>
              <p style = "size: 20px; color:white; text-align: center; font-family: Antiqua"> This episode targets people who waste time spending ridiculous hours playing online role-playing games.  They depict scenes in which the four main characters who play this game and do nothing else. 
The social issue at hand is that this episode explains that people  are who are social outcasts can be viewed as strong individuals in the game and can be one reason why they become so addicted. 
Basically, the creators are saying that people who play such games have no life and are wasting their time playing pointless computer games instead of being outside. Characters throughout the show dramatize the importance of the game by spending ridiculous hours playing and ignoring other everyday activities.

 <h1 style = "color:yellow; font-family: Antiqua">Blog Entry #3: Chrysler and Selling Cars</h1>
                        <p style = "size: 20px; color:white; text-align: center; font-family: Antiqua"> Imagery of Detroit: <br>In this chrysler advertisement, they display footage of some of the uncommon nice looking areas of Detroit such as the  intersection of Woodward and E. Jefferson. This induces the idea that Detroit is powerful, efficient city to a largely ignorant super bowl audience. If they showed footage of the area surrounding the chrysler plant (which is a 7 minute drive from the small area they limited the footage to) they would not sell any cars because the advertisement would be meaningless. Anyways, what the imagery( fist statue, white girl ice-skating, century old painting of conveyor belt laborers, etc,) is that detroit is a normal, hardworking city that produces decent automobiles.
<br>
The Voiceover :<br>The man speaking sounds aged, wise and has a clear voice. He sounds like someone who's been through a lot of difficult times. It’s really obvious that chrysler's marketing team is trying to convey that Detroit is also aged, wise, and been through a lot of difficult times. By transmitting the idea that Detroit is experienced and proficient to the ignorant public, Chrysler will sell more cars.



<br>
Inclusion of Eminem/”Lose Yourself”: <br>Eminems Lose yourself was a smash hit over a decade ago and now that eminems audience from that time have grown up and a reasonable portion of them have grown up and acquired high paying jobs, they can afford Chryslers new vehicles. Also, the fact that the song is supposed to represent getting through tough times is supposed to mirror Detroit’s history. Because it has already been established that this song appeals to a huge margin of Chryslers target demographic (the song was incredibly popular) it was a smart move on chryslers end to remix it by adding a choir in order to make the commercial and Detroit’ history more profound than it really is, selling more cars.</p>

<h1 style = "color:yellow; font-family: Antiqua">Blog Entry #4:Groupwork : Who Would've Known</h1>
              <p style = "size: 20px; color:white; text-align: center; font-family: Antiqua"> All my life, group assignments were my worst nightmare. To me, they were the embodiement of the old phrase "If you want things done right, just do it yourself". Ever since I can remember, when I was paired up for a group assignment, the people would not share my enthusiasim for having high standards in grades or they would be lazy or simply wouldn't care about the task. Today in WRA 110 my Remix groupmates were competent and knew what they were doing. I am pleasently surprised and have now seen how efficient and helpful groupwork can be if one's peers are capable people!
