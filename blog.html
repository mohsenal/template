                        <h1 style = "color:yellow; font-family: Antiqua">Blog Entry #1: Homosexuality Video</h1>
                        <p style = "size: 20px; color:white; text-align: center; font-family: Antiqua">The goal of this video is to shift societal attitudes towards homosexuality. The video attempts achieve its purpose by utilizes pathos as part of discussing a narrative in which the narrator’s gay uncle commits suicide. The narrator discusses the emotional outcomes of this event in a way that a wide audience can relate to.Structurally, this video begins with a presentation that introduces the topic of gay acceptance and is followed by the narrator telling the story. He conveys it in a way that heavily relies on pathos (emotional appeal). He discusses how his uncle lived and how his social pressures ultimately caused him to commit suicide. The narrator then discusses how this event caused him and the rest of his family to feel.  This structure helps the video achieve it’s goals by allowing the viewer to place themselves in he narrators shoes. The video ends with a presentation that wraps up the videos message and presents a message to gay people who need help coping with their situation. In terms of my Lived Experience project, this video shows a good example of pathos and if that was a tool that I decide to employ, this video would provide a good example.</p>

                        <h1 style = "color:yellow; font-family: Antiqua">Blog Entry #2: Make Love, not Warcraft</h1>
              <p style = "size: 20px; color:white; text-align: center; font-family: Antiqua"> This episode targets people who waste time spending ridiculous hours playing online role-playing games.  They depict scenes in which the four main characters who play this game and do nothing else. 
The social issue at hand is that this episode explains that people  are who are social outcasts can be viewed as strong individuals in the game and can be one reason why they become so addicted. 
Basically, the creators are saying that people who play such games have no life and are wasting their time playing pointless computer games instead of being outside. Characters throughout the show dramatize the importance of the game by spending ridiculous hours playing and ignoring other everyday activities.

 <h1 style = "color:yellow; font-family: Antiqua">Blog Entry #3: Chrysler and Selling Cars</h1>
                        <p style = "size: 20px; color:white; text-align: center; font-family: Antiqua"> Imagery of Detroit: <br>In this chrysler advertisement, they display footage of some of the uncommon nice looking areas of Detroit such as the  intersection of Woodward and E. Jefferson. This induces the idea that Detroit is powerful, efficient city to a largely ignorant super bowl audience. If they showed footage of the area surrounding the chrysler plant (which is a 7 minute drive from the small area they limited the footage to) they would not sell any cars because the advertisement would be meaningless. Anyways, what the imagery( fist statue, white girl ice-skating, century old painting of conveyor belt laborers, etc,) is that detroit is a normal, hardworking city that produces decent automobiles.
<br>
The Voiceover :<br>The man speaking sounds aged, wise and has a clear voice. He sounds like someone who's been through a lot of difficult times. It’s really obvious that chrysler's marketing team is trying to convey that Detroit is also aged, wise, and been through a lot of difficult times. By transmitting the idea that Detroit is experienced and proficient to the ignorant public, Chrysler will sell more cars.



<br>
Inclusion of Eminem/”Lose Yourself”: <br>Eminems Lose yourself was a smash hit over a decade ago and now that eminems audience from that time have grown up and a reasonable portion of them have grown up and acquired high paying jobs, they can afford Chryslers new vehicles. Also, the fact that the song is supposed to represent getting through tough times is supposed to mirror Detroit’s history. Because it has already been established that this song appeals to a huge margin of Chryslers target demographic (the song was incredibly popular) it was a smart move on chryslers end to remix it by adding a choir in order to make the commercial and Detroit’ history more profound than it really is, selling more cars.</p>

<h1 style = "color:yellow; font-family: Antiqua">Blog Entry #4:Groupwork : Who Would've Known</h1>
              <p style = "size: 20px; color:white; text-align: center; font-family: Antiqua"> All my life, group assignments were my just a bad time. To me, they were the embodiement of the old phrase "If you want things done right, just do it yourself". Ever since I can remember, when I was paired up for a group assignment, the people would not share my enthusiasim for having high standards in grades or they would be lazy or simply wouldn't care about the task. Today in WRA 110 my Remix groupmates were competent and knew what they were doing. I am pleasently surprised and have now seen how efficient and helpful groupwork can be if one's peers are capable people!

              <h1 style = "color:yellow; font-family: Antiqua">Blog Entry #5:Groupwork : Day 2</h1>
              <p style = "size: 20px; color:white; text-align: center; font-family: Antiqua"> Today in WRA we met up in class and discussed our game plan for completing the remix assignment. Unfortunetly, the fourth group memeber hasn't been doing anything and has missed class for a second time. I will make sure she gets no points. We decided that Carson will do the narration and that it is up to me and Nate to get some interview footage. Also, we are looking for youtube videos to extract clips from that would be relevent to the end product we are hoping to produce.

      <h1 style = "color:yellow; font-family: Antiqua">Blog Entry #6: Finding the Right Interviewee</h1>
              <p style = "size: 20px; color:white; text-align: center; font-family: Antiqua">  
              Yesterday, we decided that among other things, I need to conduct an interview of someone who was a victim of racial profiling. So far, finding that person has not been easy. In asking several people, I realized that it is not as easy as one would assume to find someone who was racially profiled. Basically, the method I am using to find potiential participants is a simple approach and ask method. Maybe, I need to start putting up fliars or start sending emails? My experience with emails in thi assignment was pretty negative. I emailed several proffessors to be inerviewed and my efforts were fruitless. I hope to find and interview and record footage of an interview by Wednesday.

      <h1 style = "color:yellow; font-family: Antiqua">Blog Entry #7: Issues with Groupwork</h1>
              <p style = "size: 20px; color:white; text-align: center; font-family: Antiqua">  
             I feel like this assingment has me putting levels of faith in people I'm not comfortable with. We divided the work equally, and I trust my groupmates (well, 2 of them - We'll get to that later), but it's just weird that I am essentially putting my grade in someone elses hand. That's the problem with groupwork, I have to just let my groupmates do their thing- and if it's not up to my standards I guess I'll have no choice but to redo their parts. But that doesn't seem to be the case for this assignment. Everyone is doing what they were assigned except that one chinese girl. What is her problem? She hasn't shown up to class since the day that we recieved our groupmembers names. She has contributed nothing, litterrally nothing! 0! to this assingment. If she gets any points, ANY points at all, there will be a big problem.
