                        <p style = "size: 20px; color:white; text-align: center">The goal of this video is too shift societal attitudes to homosexuality. The video attempts achieve its purpose by utilizes pathos as part of discussing a narrative in which the narrator’s gay uncle commits suicide. The narrator discusses the emotional outcomes of this event in a way that a wide audience can relate to.Structurally, this video begins with a presentation that introduces the topic of gay acceptance and is followed by the narrator telling the story. He conveys it in a way that heavily relies on pathos (emotional appeal). He discusses how his uncle lived and how his social pressures ultimately caused him to commit suicide. The narrator then discusses how this event caused him and the rest of his family to feel.  This structure helps the video achieve it’s goals by allowing the viewer to place themselves in he narrators shoes. The video ends with a presentation that wraps up the videos message and presents a message to gay people who need help coping with their situation. In terms of my Lived Experience project, this video shows a good example of pathos and if that was a tool that I decide to employ, this video would provide a good example.</p>
