		<p>In 2007, there were approximately 1.7 million people living with missing limbs in the US.  It is due to statistics such as this that I hope to one day become a prosthetist. The computer is a form of technology that played an immense role in this decision. As my use of computers supplemented my artistic abilities, I realized that I wanted to create prosthetic limbs for people who needed them, and that my computer skills would aid me in the process.
When I was 6 years old, I got my hands on a computer for the first time. I vividly remember being fascinated with a basic version of Microsoft Excel and spending hours playing with Paint. Of course, this was 13 years ago and the personal computer had not yet taken the world by storm. Over the years, my fascination with computers only grew and I found myself testing the waters of different programs and computer applications. 
   I began shooting and editing special effects videos at 13. Each day I would test some new special effects, exploring different plug-ins, take a crack at a new feature and then go back and make more videos.  Besides drawing and painting, creating videos was another artistic outlet for me, and naturally it was something I grew to become very enthusiastic about. Eventually my skill grew to the point where I was competent in several programs and was capable enough to monetize my abilities. One day I received an email to create a logo that involved some 3D modeling. This was foreign to me, but naturally I was intrigued. Prior to this, I stayed away from such programs, telling myself things like “That’s too advanced, I’ll need classes for that” or “When the time comes, I’ll dive into that program” almost as if I was procrastinating testing out these programs. I installed Blender, a freeware where I learned many of the basics of modeling. I spent months and months watching tutorials and reading books on modeling. I slowly moved on to different programs such as 3D max and Solidworks. This was a hobby I could easily see myself making a career out of.  
My first academic use of my motion graphics abilities began when I was tasked with a semester long research project for my High School Scientific Investigations class. The research project I designed aimed to see how vehicle shape affects aerodynamic drag. I sketched out multiple car designs, examined them and picked the 10 most promising designs. I spent several days modeling my designs as detailed as I possibly could. With the help of my older brother, a mechanical engineer employed in the automobile industry, I ran computer simulations that mimicked how air would interact with my vehicles at different speeds. It was as if my designs had come to life. The computer program would simulate how air flows around the vehicle, the path it takes behind the vehicle, even how it would twist and loop if it managed to get inside the vehicle. I was mesmerized. This project opened my eyes to the power of computer simulations in real world applications.  From that day I knew that I wanted to do this for a living. 
Ever since I could remember, I liked to draw. My father was an illustrator and there are several professional artists in my family. I naturally found the process of creating art to be a cathartic process. From getting my first water color set to my first collection of drawing pencils, my interest in art only grew. The computer is a piece of technology that has undoubtedly played the biggest role in my decision to pursue the field of prosthetics, and art was the catalyst.
Prosthetists are people who design prosthetic limbs for people who do not have them as a result of accidents or genetic defects. Each amputee has special circumstances and different conditions, so a specialized prosthetic must be made. The human body is a highly complex, sophisticated system. Limb movement involves several body parts to work together at certain angles, amid various conditions, under various pressures, temperatures—the list goes on. Each limb is part of a sophisticated system, and the intricate interactions that take place are not easy to artificially produce. As technology advances, actuators, sensors, micro­processors, and control software will all be involved in the process and in each case, computer use is heavily involved. Prosthetic limbs need to modeled, tested, and put under various simulations before they can actually be used by an amputee. Computers play an incredible role in the process of designing and implementing a prosthetic limb, as well as creativity and ingenuity. This is how the computer is linked to my career path. My modeling abilities and artistic talents will only supplement my journey into the field of prosthetics. However, getting into the field of prosthetics is no simple task. There are many steps one must follow to become a certified prosthetist.
 Receiving an undergraduate education is the first step. My major at Michigan State University is currently “pre-med”, which is a temporary major for those who know that they will pursue a medical field but are not sure which specific major to pick. To get into an Orthotics and Prosthetics program, I need a bachelor’s degree. Any major can be picked as long as I complete the required prerequisite courses. Different Orthotics and Prosthetics programs have different pre-requisites but not unlike medical school pre-requisites, biology, chemistry, physics, psychology, mathematics, and human anatomy and physiology with lab time are among the required classes. 
The prosthetics profession has been evolving over past decades and has established its practitioners as healthcare professionals instead of technicians who simply just build basic prosthetics. As a result of this, a master's degree is required before any certification is granted. More specifically, it was decided in January 2013 that a master's degree in Orthotics and Prosthetics is the new standard to become a certified practitioner. According to the National Commission on Orthotic and Prosthetic Education (NCOPE), there are 12 master’s degree programs across the United States that grants such a certification. Eastern Michigan University’s College of Health and Human Services in Ypsilanti holds the only Orthotic-Prosthetic program in the state. The next step in completing the program is to complete residency that is approved by NCOPE . Residency programs are important as they “contribute to the continuing education of future O&P professionals. These programs provide students with a structured experience by complying with the established standards and guidelines. It is during the residency program that individuals gain the clinical training and experience needed to balance their primary education with experience to generate the best practitioner possible.” (NCOPE). The last step remaining before becoming a certified prosthetist is to pass exams from one or both of the two national certifying agencies, the American Board for Certification in Orthotics, Prosthetics and Pedorthics (ABC) and the Board of Certification/Accreditation, International (BOC). After completing this task, one is now a certified prosthetist.
Saying that I have a long journey ahead is an understatement. However, my lived experiences with computers and my artistic abilities can only help me in this venture. The computer supplemented my artistic interests and helped me in identifying key talents I can take advantage of in my current career goal of one day becoming a certified prosthetist.
