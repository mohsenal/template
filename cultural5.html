			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>PWhen one flaunts ghetto ideologies and embraces a ghetto lifestyle, they are part of the problem. What this means is that to diminish the spread of ghetto culture, the idea that flaunting the characteristics of such a culture is acceptable must be expunged.  Ghetto culture must be refused and society must normalize and commend an anti-ghetto culture. This involves many steps that may seem like ordinary attributes at first, but aim to rehabilitate the core obstacles within the ghetto culture mentality. These include the dismissal of ghetto music or music that glorifies the principles of ghetto culture, the rejection of ghetto dress and demeanor, the recognition of the value of education in all forms (and just as importantly- the refusal to celebrate ignorance), obeying just laws and working to change unjust laws and finally to gain dignity and respect for oneself while aiming to become a motivational example of what unsubscribing from a ghetto mentality can lead one to achieve.</p>
